1. In each round, the drawn set is equally likely to be Up, Middle, and Down. <br><br>
2. Your role will be fixed in the experiment. In each round a sender is matched with a receiver and participants will be randomly rematched in every round.  <br><br>
3. The payoffs are determined by the drawn set and the receiver’s guess, but not by the sender’s messages.<br><br>
4. When the sender answers the questions, they can only see the drawn set in this round but not the other two undrawn sets. <br><br>
5. The set of cards for Up, Middle and Down will change in every round.<br><br>
